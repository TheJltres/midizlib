# midizilib
This project provides a library for parsing MIDI files using the **Zig** programming language.
The goal is to offer an efficient and easy-to-use implementation for reading and processing standard `.mid` MIDI files.

## Features
- **MIDI file reading**: Parses standard MIDI files.
- **Typed events**: Extracts and processes "Note On", "Note Off", "Control Change", "Program Change" events, and more.
- **No dependencies**: Fully implemented in Zig with no external dependencies.

## TODO
[ ] Add docs
[ ] Add more events
[ ] More input methods
[ ] No memcopy
[ ] Write .mid?
